# Introduction

Welcome to the Sate API! This document describes how 3rd party applications can integrate with Sate, to create and monitor a wealth of services that we offer.

We currently have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

If you would like to request any additional bindings, then please contact the Technology Team at tech@sate.com.au and we will aim to add them in the near future.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'sate'

api = Sate::APIClient.authorize!('your_api_key')
```

```python
import sate

api = sate.authorize('your_api_key')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_TOKEN]" https://app.sate.com.au/api/v1/
   
```

```javascript
const sate = require('yourapikey');

let api = sate.authorize('yourapikey');
```

> Make sure to replace `your api key` with your API key.

Sate uses API Bearer Tokens to permit access to our API. You can register for a new Lendflow API key on our [client portal](http://sate.com.au) in less than 60 seconds.

Sate expects for the Bearer Token to be included in all API requests made to the server in the header that takes the following form:

`Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_TOKEN]`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>[YOUR_TOKEN]</code> with your personal API key.
